This code is for a cashier system that has 7 functions to facilitate efficient and effective management of transactions.

Display options - This function provides a user interface for the cashier to choose from the available functions in the system. The options include adding items, displaying the cart, deleting items, checking out, checking the total selling, and checking the quantity available. This function ensures that the cashier is aware of the functions available to them and can easily access them as needed.

Add items - This function allows the cashier to add items to the cart by selecting them from the inventory. The system should be designed to retrieve the item information, such as the name, price, and quantity, from the inventory database. The cashier can then add the desired items to the cart, which will be used to calculate the total cost of the transaction.

Display cart - This function displays the items currently in the cart. It should show the name, price, and quantity of each item, as well as the total cost of the transaction. This function provides the cashier with a visual representation of the items in the cart, making it easier to verify that the correct items have been added and the total cost is accurate.

Delete items - This function allows the cashier to remove items from the cart. This may be necessary if the cashier makes a mistake when adding items or if a customer changes their mind about a purchase. The cashier should be able to select the item to be removed, and the system should then update the cart accordingly.

Check out - This function processes the payment and saves the transaction details in a file. The cashier should be able to enter the payment amount and receive a receipt of the transaction. The receipt should include the item details, the total cost, and the payment amount. The transaction details should be saved in a file for future reference and analysis.

Total selling - This function displays the total amount of sales made by the system. This information is useful for management to track the overall performance of the business and make informed decisions about inventory, staffing, and other factors. The total selling should be calculated based on the transactions that have been processed through the check out function.

Quantity available - This function displays the available quantity of a specific item in the inventory. This information is useful for the cashier to ensure that the desired item is in stock before adding it to the cart. The cashier should be able to search for the item by name, and the system should retrieve the relevant information from the inventory database.

Overall, this code provides a comprehensive solution for managing transactions in a retail environment. The 7 functions work together to ensure that transactions are processed efficiently and accurately, and that relevant information is stored for future use.

Also, If you're just getting warmed up in programming this would be a good topic to start with as your first real project.
